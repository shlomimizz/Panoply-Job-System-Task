# Panoply Job System Task

Hi, Thanks for the opportunity @ Panoply and a challenging Task to handle!

## Short Description of the offered program

Most of the code is explained by documentation and relevant comments.
I used Java Threading/Pools abstractions and latest Features of the language to solve the problem.

I focused on delivering the code with correctness, performance, modularity and readability.


## RUNNING (TESTED UNDER LINUX UBUNTU)
Can you use any Java IDE (I used IntelliJ for developing) to run the main program which demonstrates the trivial check, or the Test Suite which inspects the code further more


# Tests

In the tests, I offered 5 different Suites, such as Input Validation Suite, State Lookup (n correctness) Validation, etc. Tests can be further extended to check the performance under high-loads for jobs, or jobs that are long term using multiple resources, check more invalid flows and extreme cases such as bad inputs.

# Possible Extensions

This Program offers a minimalist solution for a large problem, can be thought as Producer/Consumer.
a Reactive approach could be a nice way to create a good solution.

Also, this program should include error logging, exception handling, persistent storage for high load of jobs (we wouldn't want to keep a Scheduled job for 12H in the memory all this time) and more basic production-level features / upgrades.
